# Recommendation-System
This project aims to build a basic recommender system for widely known podcast and music app, Spotify.
All the notebook, powerpoint presentation and the dataset used in this project are added to the repository.
Instead of using categorical variables, only the technical and numerical variables were fed into the model.
Similarities are based on the technical features of the musics. The system is supposed to take a dataframe,
the name of the song, and requested number of outputs as input.
It returns the top N songs based on technical similarities to the track given as input with an order.
